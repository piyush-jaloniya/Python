This project, titled "Data Analysis and Visualization Tool with Tkinter GUI", aims to create a user-friendly application that allows users to explore datasets and visualize data through various plot types. Built with Python and utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tkinter, the project provides a streamlined experience for loading CSV files, selecting data columns, and generating statistical information.

The tool offers five types of plots—line, bar, histogram, scatter, and box—allowing users to view data trends and distributions visually. The Tkinter-based graphical user interface includes interactive elements like dropdown menus for plot and column selection, buttons for loading data and generating plots, and dialog boxes to display statistical information. Error handling is incorporated to handle scenarios like missing data and non-numeric columns, ensuring smooth operation.

Overall, the project combines data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization in a single tool, making it accessible for users without coding experience to explore datasets. Through this project, key skills in Python programming, data visualization, and GUI development were reinforced, demonstrating how Python can be used to create powerful yet user-friendly data analysis applications.
